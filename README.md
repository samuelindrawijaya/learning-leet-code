# Samuel's Developer Journey
## Daily Practice Routine
I follow a simple but consistent routine:

- 1–2 Algorithm Problems per Day
- Pattern Reflection & Notes
- Documentation Reading
- Personal/Work Projects Improvement

Some days are lighter, some are deeper —  
consistency matters more than intensity.

## Why Algorithms?
Algorithms train:
- Logical thinking
- Pattern recognition
- Problem breakdown
- Confidence in interviews
- Independence from tools

The goal is not speed or ranking,  
but **mental sharpness and clarity.**

## Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving fundamentals
- Become highly reliable backend/system engineer
- Work on impactful products
- Improve English communication
- Open opportunities for international or remote work
