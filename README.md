# Samuel's Developer Journey

## About Me
I am a software developer focused on continuous learning and problem solving.  
I enjoy backend development, system design, and strengthening my logical thinking through daily algorithm practice.

This repository is not only about code —  
it is about discipline, growth, and building strong fundamentals.

---

## Current Focus
- Data Structures & Algorithms (LeetCode)
- SQL & Database Optimization
- Backend Architecture
- Clean Code & Documentation
- English Communication for Tech

---

## Daily Practice Routine
I follow a simple but consistent routine:

- 1–2 Algorithm Problems per Day
- Pattern Reflection & Notes
- Documentation Reading
- Personal/Work Projects Improvement

Some days are lighter, some are deeper —  
consistency matters more than intensity.

---

## Why Algorithms?
Algorithms train:
- Logical thinking
- Pattern recognition
- Problem breakdown
- Confidence in interviews
- Independence from tools

The goal is not speed or ranking,  
but **mental sharpness and clarity.**
